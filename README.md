# Arithmetic Logic Unit

The ***ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)*** is a component of computer hardware that resides in the CPU and performs all arithmetical and logical operations.

## Parameters of this ALU

This ALU has been designed to perform 64-bit operations. It will take two 64-bit input values, along with a 4 bit selection input to decide what operation will be performed.

This is a table that demonstrates what operations will be performed based on the operation selection value.

## Features of this ALU

### Transfer Reg A

  - This will simply print the current value of register A

### Increment Reg A

  - This will increment A by 1, it will also account for carry.

### Decrement Reg A

  - This will decrement register A by 1.

### Perform Addition

  - This will perform addition between register A and register B. 

### Negate Reg A

  - This will logically negate the value of the A register: NOT(A).

### Perform AND operation between A and B registers

  - This will logically AND the value of the A register and B register.

### Perform OR operation between A and B registers

  - This will logically OR the values of the A register and B register.

### Perform XOR operation between A and B registers

  - This will logically XOR the values of the A register and B register.

### Perform Arithmetic Shift (Left or Right)

  - This will perform arithmetic shifting.

### Perform Logical Shift (Left or Right)

  - This will perform logical shifting.
